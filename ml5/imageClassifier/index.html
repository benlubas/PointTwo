        <div class="desc">
          Trained on 800 images of each type. This network is not really the
          greatest in terms of accuracy, but it was so awseome to see it
          working. <br />
          <br />
          It is capable of very unconfidently telling you if your image is a
          triangle, a hexagon or a tennis racket.

        <div class="title">Failure Number One</div>
        <div class="desc">
          This one was a little ambitious, I tried to train it with about 10 different 
          images and 5000 training images in each sample. Chrome can't keep that many images in memory at once without crashing.
          So I knocked it down to 2000 training images each, this resulted in a network that didn't really work, but here it is anyway.

      <div class="card">
        <div class="title">Showcase 1 (eh)</div>
        <div class="desc">
          To call it a showcase is almost overstating this network's ability. 
          It can recognize snowflakes, squares, hexagons, and octagons. Nothing too crazy. 
          It was trained on 5000 of each test images. 
          it doesn't do too well. The loss was minimized,
          but when some other images were tested, the network had an average corrrectness of 29%. 
          Now that's really really bad.

        <div class="title">Showcase 2</div>
        <div class="desc">
          We're trying this one with a bunch of completely different things. 
          5000 of each image again. Accuracy in the 30% range this time. 
          It helps if you draw things large, and take up the whole screen. 
          If you can get it to acuurately recognize a traffic light, good job.
